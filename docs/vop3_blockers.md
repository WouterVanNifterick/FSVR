# VOP3 rewrite blockers

What stops a C++ rewrite of VOP3-1 (filter) and VOP3-2 (effects) from the disassembly, as found on 2026-09-30 when the rewrite was attempted. The decode in `docs/vop3_isa.md` is measured field by field on feed-forward test chains, and every one of those measurements holds. The blockers below are what those chains never exercised. `python tools/vop3_gaps.py` asserts the first three and fails as each closes.

The existing models in `src/fs1r/chips/vop3_filter.h` and `vop3_effects.h` are fitted to recordings and are not a reference for the rewrite. The only acceptance test is the demo pair: `captures/raw/FS1R DEMO.flac` (with VOP3) against `FS1R.unlock/captures/2026-09-22/fs1r_demos_without_vop3.flac` (without).

## 1. The decoded VOP3-1 filter has no memory

An impulse on any register that filter channel 0 reads and no class-1 step loads (`r[02..05]`, `r[0e]`, `r[10]`, `r[11]`, `r[62]`, `r[63]`, `r[65]`, `r[7f]`) leaves in the same pass with no tail. A filter without state is not a filter. Feeding class-2 results back into `r[n]` or `r[40|n]`, in the same pass or the next, changes nothing, so the state path is something the decode does not have yet. Candidates: `path` `r9[11:8]` (exact-match on the feedback loop, session 8; inert feed-forward, session 12), class 3, and blocker 4.

## 2. The assembled VOP3-2 program reaches no output

Base image plus reverb 0, variation 0 and insertion 0/0 at the `FUN_00039C8A` windows, audio on the input port, every constant 0.5: zero non-zero output samples in 4096. The interpreter's only output is `bus += y` on an op-1 step with route 0, a reading taken off VOP3-1's output stages (session 10), and no shipped VOP3-2 program has such a step. Only test image 1 names its outputs (`0e9`/`0eb`, op 7 reading `d[]`). Which steps of a shipped program feed the DAC, and by what mechanism, is unknown.

## 3. Class 3 is not decoded

`r6[15:14] = 3` was seen once, as "the loop runs away" when a class-2 step was flipped to 3 (session 8). Shipped programs use it deliberately: 32 steps of VOP3-1, 27 of the assembled VOP3-2, and 16 of reverb 0's 29 live steps (`0e8`, `0ea`, `0ec`, `0ee`, ... a pair per comb, around a class-2 accumulate). The reverb cannot run without it.

## 4. Nothing reads `w[]`

Class-2 results are written to `w[wdst]`, which the decode reads only through `rsrc`, and session 14 found `w[rsrc]` never enters the arithmetic. So every `-> w[n]` write in the listings goes nowhere the model can see. A write area the program fills on almost every step must be read somewhere, and this is the most likely seat of the missing state in blocker 1. The `r[]` stride test (`tools/vop3_verify.py`) rules out `w[n]` as `r[40|n]`.

## 5. `rd-en` with rB set is measured on op 1 only

Session 14 measured `rd-en` with rB set as "k is dropped" on an op-1 step (`y = x`). The disassembler and interpreter generalize that to `g = 0` on every op, which makes op 2 and op 3 print `y = 0`. Shipped programs use the combination on every op: VOP3-1 has 64 op 0, 48 op 1, 16 op 2, 64 op 3 and 32 op 5 steps; VOP3-2 76, 20, 14, 76 and 10. So 80 VOP3-1 steps decode to a constant zero, which no program would ship. Whether "dropped" means `g = 0`, `g = 1`, or that `w[rsrc]` replaces `k` on ops other than 1 is open, and the answer bears on blocker 4.

## 6. Class 1 with rB set

81 class-1 steps across the FS1R listings carry an rB (`r[68] = k/256 rB=r[62]`), and on class 1 every other `r6` bit was inert (session 8). The role of that rB is unknown; the decode treats these as plain loads.

## 7. Delay-memory marks off phase 3

Session 16 found DRAM transfers only on steps 3 mod 4 and reads on phase 0 or 2 transfer nothing. The shipped VOP3-2 programs carry 50 marks off phase 3: 30 writes (`mem1`) on phases 0, 1 and 2, 6 reads on phase 1 and 3 `mem6` marks. Off-phase writes and phase-1 anything were never tried. Yamaha would not ship 50 inert marks, so either the phase rule has more to it or these steps do something else.

## 8. The constants and offsets are not in the images

`FUN_00039652` writes each step's constant (register 0xB) from `DAT_0106842c`, and `FUN_000397F4` each slot's delay offset (0xD/0xE) from `DAT_0106882c` plus a per-selector base (`DAT_010683F8..08`). About thirty parameter handlers fill those arrays (`FUN_0039B09C`, `FUN_003A160C`, ...). Until they are read, a VOP3-2 program runs with no real coefficients or delay lengths. VOP3-1's constants are in the EPROM (`docs/vop3/coefficients_*.bin`) and patched per type and per tick (`FUN_0000D050`, `FUN_0000B6A4`).

## 9. Inferred, not measured

- **Register banking per filter channel.** Clearing channel 4's cutoff load closes channel 4 though four other steps load the same `r[61]` with the same word (session 8), so the interpreter banks `r[]` sixteen ways by step position. The banking rule is an inference.
- **What fills the unloaded `r[]`.** Below 0x40 nothing in a program writes them, so they are taken as hardware inputs (serial ports, internal generators). Which register carries which voice's audio into VOP3-1, and which carry the mixer buses into VOP3-2, is not mapped.
- **Output word and lag.** The 18-bit output (LSB 2^-17) and the 2-sample lag are measured (session 12) and not modelled.

## 10. The disassembler's self-checks did not catch this

`tools/vop3_disasm.py` and `tools/vop3_interp.py` both print `ok`: each reproduces the sessions it was built from and never runs a shipped program end to end. `tools/vop3_gaps.py` is that missing check.

## Routes that need no capture session

1. **The EX5 MEG, run by value.** MAME's `swp30.cpp` gives every MEG step explicit arithmetic. Port its step function next to `tools/vop3_interp.py`, run the EX5 AN program (`EX5_TG1.bin` 0x3C97D4) and the PLG150-AN/AN1x VOP3 AN program on the same patch, and match steps by signal. The MEG shows its state writes, feedback taps and output stage outright, which addresses blockers 1 to 5.
2. **The Yamaha iOS app's AN engine.** If it executes VOP3 microcode it is the whole ISA; if it is a native port, it gives values at every point the MEG gives only structure. AARCH64, so Ghidra reads it.
3. **The effect parameter handlers** (blocker 8), from the FS1R Ghidra database. They also label class-3 steps by role, as the steps a "reverb time" or "high damp" handler writes.
4. **The demo pair** as the acceptance test: a decode is right when the dry take run through it gives the wet take, song by song, which is several independent datasets.

A capture session closes any one blocker directly: class 3 on `0e8`/`0ea`, the output steps of a loaded effect, `rd-en` on op 2/3, and `path` with class 3 on VOP3-1's `098`/`0c4`.
